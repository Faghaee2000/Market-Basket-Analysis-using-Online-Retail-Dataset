# Market-Basket-Analysis-using-Online-Retail-Dataset
The goal of this project is to analyze transactional data from a UK-based online retail store to uncover frequently co-purchased items and extract association rules using the Apriori algorithm. These insights can help drive strategic decisions in marketing, promotions, product placement, and recommendation systems.
